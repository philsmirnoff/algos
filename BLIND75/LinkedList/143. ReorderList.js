var reorderList = function(head) {

Explanation
Step 1: Find the Middle
The two-pointer technique helps identify the middle of the linked list:

slow moves one step at a time.
fast moves two steps at a time.
When fast reaches the end, slow is at the middle of the list.
Example:

Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
After the loop:
slow points to 3.
Step 2: Reverse the Second Half
Reverse the second half of the list starting from the middle using the iterative reversal technique:

Initialize prev to null and curr to slow.
Reverse the next pointers as you iterate through the second half.
Example:

Before reversal: 3 -> 4 -> 5
After reversal: 5 -> 4 -> 3
Step 3: Merge Two Halves
Merge the two halves by alternating nodes from the first and reversed second halves:

Use two pointers: first (start of the first half) and second (start of the reversed second half).
Update next pointers to interleave nodes.
Example:

First half: 1 -> 2 -> 3
Reversed second half: 5 -> 4 -> 3
Merged list: 1 -> 5 -> 2 -> 4 -> 3
Example Walkthrough
Input: head = [1, 2, 3, 4]
Step 1: Find the middle

slow ends at 3.
Step 2: Reverse the second half

Reversed second half: 4 -> 3.
Step 3: Merge

First half: 1 -> 2
Reversed second half: 4 -> 3
Merged: 1 -> 4 -> 2 -> 3.
Output: [1, 4, 2, 3]
Example: head = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Step 1: Find the middle

slow ends at 3.
Step 2: Reverse the second half

Reversed second half: 5 -> 4 -> 3.
Step 3: Merge

First half: 1 -> 2 -> 3
Reversed second half: 5 -> 4 -> 3
Merged: 1 -> 5 -> 2 -> 4 -> 3.
Output: [1, 5, 2, 4, 3]
Complexity Analysis
Time Complexity:

Finding the middle: O(n).
Reversing the second half: O(n).
Merging the two halves: O(n).
Total: O(n).
Space Complexity:

O(1) (no additional space is used apart from pointers).
This solution is optimal for the problem and follows the constraints of modifying the nodes without creating new ones.
