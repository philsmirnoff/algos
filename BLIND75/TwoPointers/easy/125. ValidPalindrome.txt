A phrase is a palindrome if, after converting all uppercase letters into lowercase letters and removing all non-alphanumeric characters, it reads the same forward and backward. Alphanumeric characters include letters and numbers.

Given a string s, return true if it is a palindrome, or false otherwise.



Example 1:

Input: s = "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
Output: true
Explanation: "amanaplanacanalpanama" is a palindrome.
Example 2:

Input: s = "race a car"
Output: false
Explanation: "raceacar" is not a palindrome.
Example 3:

Input: s = " "
Output: true
Explanation: s is an empty string "" after removing non-alphanumeric characters.
Since an empty string reads the same forward and backward, it is a palindrome.



 we will use two pointers left pointer and right pointer
 /**
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var isPalindrome = function(s) {
    // two pointers
    // Remove all spaces and special characters from s
    s = s.replace(/[^0-9a-z]/gi, "").toLowerCase();
	// Set left pointer at starting index
    let l = 0;
	// Set right pointer at final index
    let r = s.length - 1;
	// Compare opposite left and right characters until we meet in the middle
    while (l <= r) {
	    // Simply return false if the left and right characters aren't the same
        if (s[l] != s[r]) return false;
		// Otherwise, continue moving the left and right pointers one step in
        l++;
        r--;
    }
	// If we get through the whole array without failing, s is a palindrome
    return true;
    }

 Key Points of Your Solution
Cleaning the String:

You correctly use s.replace(/[^0-9a-z]/gi, "").toLowerCase() to remove non-alphanumeric characters and convert the string to lowercase. This ensures that only relevant characters are considered for the palindrome check.
Two-Pointer Technique:

The use of two pointers (l and r) to compare characters from both ends of the string is efficient and straightforward. You move l rightward and r leftward, comparing characters until the pointers meet or cross.
Edge Case Handling:

Your approach handles cases with spaces, special characters, and mixed case effectively.
Efficiency:

Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the string, as you only make a single pass through the string.
Space Complexity: O(n) for the replace method and the cleaned string storage, though this is still quite efficient.
