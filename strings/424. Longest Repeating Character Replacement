You are given a string s and an integer k. You can choose any character of the string and change it to any other uppercase English character. You can perform this operation at most k times.

Return the length of the longest substring containing the same letter you can get after performing the above operations.



Example 1:

Input: s = "ABAB", k = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: Replace the two 'A's with two 'B's or vice versa.
Example 2:

Input: s = "AABABBA", k = 1
Output: 4
Explanation: Replace the one 'A' in the middle with 'B' and form "AABBBBA".
The substring "BBBB" has the longest repeating letters, which is 4.

/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @param {number} k
 * @return {number}
 */
var characterReplacement = function(s, k) {
    let left = 0, right = 0, max = 0, freqMap = {}, freqMax = 0;

    for (right = 0; right < s.length; right++) {
        freqMap[s[right]] = freqMap[s[right]] + 1 || 1;
        freqMax = Math.max(freqMap[s[right]], freqMax);

        while (right - left + 1 - freqMax > k) {
            freqMap[s[left]] -= 1;
            left++;
        }
        max = Math.max(right-left+1, max)
    }
    return max;
};
