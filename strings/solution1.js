// There is a street described by a string S. Each character in S is one of the following:
// "<" denotes a car going to the left
// ">" denotes a car going to the right
// "." denotes a speed camera
//
// Count the total number of times that cars pass by a speed camera. A car going to the left will pass every speed camera that is to the left of it. A car going to the right will pass every speed camera that is to the right of it.
// Write a function:
// function solution(S);
// that, given a string S, returns the total number of times that cars pass by a speed camera.
// Examples:
// 1. Given S = ".>...", the function should return 3
