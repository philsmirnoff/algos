75. Sort Colors
Medium


Given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.

We will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.

You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.



Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]
Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,0,1]
Output: [0,1,2]


grokking coding interview explaination:

The brute force solution will be to use an in-place sorting algorithm like Heapsort which will take . Can we do better than this? Is it possible to sort the array in one iteration?

We can use a Two Pointers approach while iterating through the array. Letâ€™s say the two pointers are called low and high which are pointing to the first and the last element of the array respectively. So while iterating, we will move all 0s before low and all 2s after high so that in the end, all 1s will be between low and high. In the end, all 0s are on the left, all 1s are in the middle, and all 2s are on the right.

Here's a detailed walkthrough of the algorithm:

We start by initializing three variables: low to 0, high to the last index of the array, and i also to 0. Low is meant to keep track of the latest position where a 0 should be placed, high is meant to keep track of the latest position where a 2 should be placed, and i is used to iterate through the array.

We then start a loop that continues as long as i is less than or equal to high. In each iteration of the loop, we check the value of the array at the index i.

If the value is 0, we swap the values at the indices i and low. We then increment both i and low, since we know that the new element at low is 0 (sorted in its correct place) and we can move to the next index.

If the value is 1, we do nothing other than increment i. This is because we want 1s to be in the middle of the array.

If the value is 2, we swap the values at i and high. However, after the swap, we only decrement high without incrementing i. This is because the new value at index i (after the swap) could be 0, 1 or 2, and we need to check this value again in the next iteration.

The swap function simply switches the values at two given indices in the array.

The process continues until i is greater than high, at which point every element in the array has been checked and placed in its correct position. Hence, the array is now sorted.


solution:
class Solution {
  sort(arr) {
    // all elements < low are 0, and all elements > high are 2
    // all elements from >= low < i are 1
    let low = 0, high = arr.length - 1, i = 0;
    while (i <= high) {
      if (arr[i] === 0) {
        [arr[i], arr[low]] = [arr[low], arr[i]]; // swap
        // increment 'i' and 'low'
        i += 1;
        low += 1;
      } else if (arr[i] === 1) {
        i += 1;
      } else { // the case for arr[i] === 2
        [arr[i], arr[high]] = [arr[high], arr[i]]; // swap
        // decrement 'high' only, after the swap the number at index 'i' could be 0, 1, 
        // or 2
        high -= 1;
      }
    }
    return arr
  }
}

another workign solution:

var sortColors = function(nums) {
    let left = 0;
    let current = 0;
    let right = nums.length - 1;
    while( current <= right ){
        if(nums[current] === 0){
            swap(nums, left, current);
            left++;
            current++;
        }else if (nums[current] === 2){
            swap(nums, current, right);
            right--;
        }else{
            current++;
        }
    }
}
    
let swap = function(nums, left, current){
    let temp = nums[left];
    nums[left] = nums[current];
    nums[current] = temp;
}
