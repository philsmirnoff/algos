largest Component

Write a function, largest component, that takes in the adjacency list of an undirected graph. the function should return the size of the largest connected component in the graph


solution

const largestComponent = (graph) => {
  const visted = new Set()
  let longest = 0
  for (let node in graph) {
    const size = exploreSize(graph, node);
    if (size > longest) longest = size;
  }
  return longest;
}

const exploreSize = (graph, node, visited) => {
  if (visited.has(node)) return 0;

  let visited.add(node);

  let size = 1;
  for (let neighbor of graph[node]) {
    size += exploreSize(graph, neighbor, visited);
  }
  return size
}
