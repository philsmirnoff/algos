Given an m x n 2D binary grid grid which represents a map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), return the number of islands.

An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.



Example 1:

Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]
Output: 1
Example 2:

Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]
]
Output: 3


def numIslands(grid):
    # Helper function to perform DFS (Depth First Search)
    def dfs(grid, i, j):
        # Check if out of bounds or water ('0')
        if i < 0 or i >= len(grid) or j < 0 or j >= len(grid[0]) or grid[i][j] == "0":
            return
        # Mark the current land cell as visited by changing it to '0'
        grid[i][j] = "0"
        # Recursively visit all adjacent land cells (up, down, left, right)
        dfs(grid, i + 1, j)  # move down
        dfs(grid, i - 1, j)  # move up
        dfs(grid, i, j + 1)  # move right
        dfs(grid, i, j - 1)  # move left

    # Initialize the island count to 0
    island_count = 0
    # Iterate over all cells in the grid
    for i in range(len(grid)):
        for j in range(len(grid[0])):
            # If the current cell is land ('1')
            if grid[i][j] == "1":
                # Perform DFS to mark all connected land cells as visited
                dfs(grid, i, j)
                # Increment the island count after a DFS traversal
                island_count += 1
    # Return the final count of islands
    return island_count

# Example usage:
grid1 = [
    ["1","1","1","1","0"],
    ["1","1","0","1","0"],
    ["1","1","0","0","0"],
    ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]

grid2 = [
    ["1","1","0","0","0"],
    ["1","1","0","0","0"],
    ["0","0","1","0","0"],
    ["0","0","0","1","1"]
]

# Running the function with example inputs
numIslands(grid1), numIslands(grid2)
