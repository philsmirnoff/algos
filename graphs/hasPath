has path
write a function, hasPath, that takes an object representing the adjacency list of a directed acyclic graph and two nodes (src, dst). the function should return a boolean indicating whether or not exists a directed path between source and destination nodes

const graph = {
  f: ['g', 'i'],
  g: ['h'],
  h: [],
  i: ['g','k'],
  j: ['i'],
  k: []
}


// dfs recursevely

const hasPath = (graph, src, dst) => {
  // base case
  if (src === dst) return true

  for (let neighbor of graph[src]) {
    // if there is connecting point between my neighbor and destination point, i know in face that there is a path between src and dst
   if (hasPath(graph, neighbor, dst) === true) {
     return true;
   }
  }
  return false
}
