Minimum island

Write a function, minimIsland, that takes in a grid, containing Ws and Ls. W represnets water and L represent land. The function should return the size of the smasllest land. An Island is a vertically or horizontally connecte dregion of land

Strategy:


1. we will start nested loops from the left to right, if the position is water we dont need to do anything
2. if the position is land we can start our dfs and I should be marking things as visited to avoid any infinite loops.  So by the time this traversal completes, I am going to mark all of these guys as visited.
3. But also wanted to determine the size of this entire island region. So every time I get a position that is a land, I should treat it as one. And then when it comes to how I implement on my traversal,I can just gather up these ones, just add them all up.
4.In this case its for and we need to have min size that we will need keep updating while traversing other islands.
5. finish the traversing and return the min value

Time:
O(rc)
Space: O(tc)
