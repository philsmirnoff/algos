You are given an integer array `nums`. You want to maximize the number of points you get by performing the following operation any number of times:

- Pick any `nums[i]` and delete it to earn `nums[i]` points. Afterwards, you must delete **every** element equal to `nums[i] - 1` and **every** element equal to `nums[i] + 1`.

Return *the **maximum number of points** you can earn by applying the above operation some number of times*.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [3,4,2]
Output: 6
Explanation: You can perform the following operations:
- Delete 4 to earn 4 points. Consequently, 3 is also deleted. nums = [2].
- Delete 2 to earn 2 points. nums = [].
You earn a total of 6 points.
```

var deleteAndEarn = function(nums) {
const map = {};
for (const num of nums) {
if (!(num in map)) map[num] = 0;
map[num]++;
}

let prevSum = 0;
let currSum = 0;
let prevKey = -1;

for (let key in map) {
const m = Math.max(prevSum, currSum);
key = parseInt(key);
if (key - 1 !== prevKey) {
currSum = key * map[key] + m;
prevSum = m;
} else {
currSum = key * map[key] + prevSum;
prevSum = m;
}
prevKey = key;
}

return Math.max(prevSum, currSum);
};
