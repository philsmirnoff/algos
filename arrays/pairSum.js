Pair Sum return boolean
Learning Objective
Apply Pointers to reduce time complexity
Interviewer Prompt
Given an array arr consisting of N integers, sorted in ascending order (least to greatest), and a separate number (a sum), determine if any 2 numbers in the array add up to the sum. Return true if any 2 different numbers within the array add up to sum. Return false if no 2 numbers in the array add up to sum.

Examples
pairSum([1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 7) -> true (either 2+5 or 3+4)
pairSum([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 10) -> false
pairSum([0, 2, 3, 6, 9, 10], 10) -> true (0 + 10)
pairSum([1, 2, 3, 7, 8], 7) -> false
pairSum([-2, 0, 4, 6, 10], 8) -> true (-2 + 10)
pairSum([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 2) -> false
Examples - Edge cases

pairSum([1], 2) -> false
pairSum([2], 2) -> false
pairSum([], 1) -> false
Brute force Solution
Approach: Nested loops
The easiest way to approach this problem is looping over the given array, fixing an element at position i and looping over it again, from i+1 up to element at N-1 position, adding the fixed element to the current one. If it matches sum returns true. Otherwise, continue the loop up to the end of the array. If there is no match, return false

Code
function pairSum(arr, sum) {
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length-1; i++) {
    const fixed = arr[i]
    for (let j = i+1; j < arr.length; j++) {
      const current = arr[j]
      if (fixed + current === sum) {
        return true
      }
    }
  }
  return false
}
Performance analysis
Time Complexity: O(N^2)
In the first loop, i runs from N-2 steps. We can consider N interations.
In the neasted loop, in the first interation, j runs for N-2 steps. The second time, it's N-3. And so on.
Considering both points about, it means the code iterates through each pair of values for (i,j) where j is bigger than i. When N = 6, those are the pairs:
(0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (0,4)
      (1,2) (1,3) (1,4)
            (2,3) (2,4)
                  (3,4)
The size of this matrix is half of a N-2 x N-2 matrix or ((N-2)Ë†2)/2. Dropping all constants, we end with a complexity of N^2

Space Complexity: O(1)
The memory needed doesn't increase based on the size of the input.


Optimized Solution
Approach: Pointers
The main hint in the prompt to devise an optimized approach is that the numbers are sorted in ascending order. With that information, it's possible to create two pointers:

One pointing to the element at position 0, that can be called leftPointer
Another one pointing to the element at position N-1, that can be called rightPointer
And using a while loop, it's possible to add the elements in the given array at leftPointer and rightPointer and compare it with sum. Based on the result, the possible outcomes are:

They are equals, function returns true;
The sum of the elements is smaller than sum, leftPointer is increased by one;
The sum of the elements is greater than sum, rightPointer is decreased by one;
The loop should breaks out when leftPointer and rightPointer are equals, meaning all the possible sum for two elements in the array were evaluated. At this point, function can return false.

visualizing the steps

input: arr = [1,3,4,5] sum = 7

                *     *
1. interation: [1,3,4,5] -> currentSum = 6 < sum -> move left pointer
                  *   *
2. interation: [1,3,4,5] -> currentSum = 8 > sum -> move right pointer
                  * *
3. interation: [1,3,4,5] -> currentSum = 7 === sum -> return true
Code
  function pairSum(arr, sum) {
  let leftPointer = 0
  let rightPointer = arr.length - 1
  while (leftPointer < rightPointer) {
    const currentSum = arr[leftPointer] + arr[rightPointer]
    if (currentSum === sum) {
      return true
    } else if (currentSum < sum) {
      leftPointer++
    } else {
      rightPointer--
    }
  }
  return false
}
Performance analysis
Time Complexity: O(N)
In the worst case, when there is no pair that adds up to the sum, the while loop will visit all the elements in the array only once.
Space Complexity: O(1)
The memory needed doesn't increase based on the size of the input.
Possible Extended Question
The brute for solution works for non sorted ingeters, but the optmized solution doesn't. How can we create a solution where the time complexity is the same one as in the optimized solution, but the integers are not sorted?

Examples
pairSum([1, 5, 2, 4, 3, 1], 7) -> true
pairSum([5, 3, 2, 4, 1], 10) -> false


Approach: Using a map
Instead of looking for pairs, it's possible to look for target values, considering the following:

target = sum - arr[i]

Using a map, we can use an object to store all the target values.

Given that, it's possible to loop over the given array, and for every value on it perform the follow:

check if the current value is already in the map. If so, it means it can be added to a previous element to add up to the sum and the function can return true;
Store the target value for the current element in the map.
If the loop breaks out without finding any match, the function returns false.

Code
function pairSum(arr, sum) {
  const targetMap = {}
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    const target = sum - arr[i]
    if (targetMap[arr[i]]) {
      return true
    } else {
      targetMap[target] = true
    }
  }
  return false
}
Performance analysis
Time Complexity: O(N)
In the worst case, i runs for N steps.
Space Complexity: O(N)
In the worst case, a new key will be added to targetMap for all elements (N) in the array

leetcode question two sum
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.



Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]
Example 3:

Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]

solution 1. brute force Time: O(n^2) Space: O(1)
const twoSum = (nums, target) => {
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    for (j = i + 1; j < nums.length; j++) {
      if (nums[i] + nums[j] === target) {
        return [i, j]
      }
    }
  }
}

console.log(twoSum([1,2,3,4], 5))

Solution 2. Hashmap Time: O(n) Space: O(n)
var twoSum = function(nums, target) {
  var map = {}
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    var value = nums[i]
    var complementPair = target - value
    if (map[complementPair] !== undefined) {
      return [map[complementPair], i]
    } else {
      map[value] = i
    }
  }
}

Solution 3. using pointers Time: O(n) Space: O(1)
const twoSum = (numbers, target) => {
  let leftP = 0
  let rightP = numbers.length - 1;
  while (leftP < rightP) {
    let currentSum = numbers[leftP] + numbers[rightP]
    if (currentSum < target) {
      leftP++
    } else if (currentSum > target) {
      rightP--
    } else {
      return [leftP, rightP]
    }
  }
}
