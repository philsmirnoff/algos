You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

Notice that you may not slant the container.



Example 1:


Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.

// To simplify the problem the value for the array looks like this (j-i) * min(height[j], [i]). we
// we want to loop through the array and find this i and j and calculate the maxArea.
// we will point i and j as front and back of the array and then we will make them move to the center untill they meet each other. the distance between j minus i


var maxArea = function(height) {
  let maxArea = 0;
  let i = 0;
  let j = height.length - 1;
  while (i < j) {
    maxArea = Math.max(maxArea, Math.min(height[i], height[j]) * (j - i));
    if (height[i] < height[j]) {
      i++;
    } else {
      j--;
    }
  }
  return maxArea;
};
