Given an integer array nums, return the number of triplets chosen from the array that can make triangles if we take them as side lengths of a triangle.



Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,2,3,4]
Output: 3
Explanation: Valid combinations are:
2,3,4 (using the first 2)
2,3,4 (using the second 2)
2,2,3
Example 2:

Input: nums = [4,2,3,4]
Output: 4

/**
 * Given an array of side lengths, return the number of valid triangles
 * that can be formed using any 3 numbers as sides.
 *
 * A triangle is valid if: a + b > c
 * (assuming the array is sorted so a <= b <= c)
 */

var triangleNumber = function(sides) {
  // Step 1️⃣: Sort the array so we can apply the triangle inequality efficiently.
  sides.sort((a, b) => a - b);

  let totalTriangles = 0; // will count the number of valid triplets

  // Step 2️⃣: Iterate from the end of the array, treating sides[longest]
  // as the largest side (c) in the triangle.
  for (let longest = sides.length - 1; longest >= 2; longest--) {
    let left = 0;              // smallest side (a)
    let right = longest - 1;   // middle side (b)

    // Step 3️⃣: Two-pointer approach
    // We'll move `left` and `right` to find all valid (a, b, c) triplets.
    while (left < right) {
      // If sides[left] + sides[right] > sides[longest],
      // then all pairs between [left ... right-1] also satisfy the inequality.
      if (sides[left] + sides[right] > sides[longest]) {
        // ✅ All values from left → right-1 are valid with this 'right'
        totalTriangles += (right - left);

        // Decrease right to check smaller middle sides
        right--;
      } else {
        // ❌ If the sum is too small, move left to increase the total
        left++;
      }
    }
  }

  // Step 4️⃣: Return the total number of valid triangles
  return totalTriangles;
};
🧠 Step-by-step reasoning
Sort the sides
Sorting ensures that for any valid triangle (a, b, c) we always have a ≤ b ≤ c,
so the triangle inequality reduces to a + b > c.

Fix the largest side (c)
We loop longest from the end of the array to the start — this represents c.

Use two pointers to find all valid pairs (a, b) for this c:

Start with left = 0 and right = longest - 1.

If sides[left] + sides[right] > sides[longest], then all pairs between left and right-1 also form valid triangles.
→ Add (right - left) to the count and move right--.

Else, move left++ to increase the sum.

Continue until all combinations are checked.

📊 Example walkthrough
Input:

js
Copy code
[2, 2, 3, 4]
Sorted → [2, 2, 3, 4]

longest = 3 (c=4)

left=0, right=2 → 2+3 > 4 ✅ add (2-0)=2

right=1 → 2+2 ≤ 4 ❌ → left++

longest = 2 (c=3)

left=0, right=1 → 2+2 > 3 ✅ add (1-0)=1
Total = 3 triangles ✅

⏱ Time and 💾 Space Complexity
Metric	Complexity	Explanation
Time	O(n²)	Outer loop O(n), inner two-pointer O(n)
Space	O(1)	Constant extra memory (in-place sort)

✅ Interview-style summary you can say out loud:
“I first sort the sides so that for each largest side c, I can efficiently find pairs (a, b) using two pointers.
If a + b > c, then all pairs between those indices are valid triangles, so I add (right - left) to the count.
Otherwise, I move the left pointer to increase the sum.
This runs in O(n²) time and O(1) space — the optimal solution.”

Would you like me to show you how to explain this visually with a small diagram (like pointer movement example) that you can use when whiteboarding this in your interview?

Perfect 👏 — a visual + verbal explanation can really impress Bloomberg interviewers.
Here’s exactly how you can draw and explain this solution step-by-step on a whiteboard (or digital pad) during the interview.

🎨 Step 1. Start with an example
Say the interviewer gives you:

js
Copy code
nums = [2, 2, 3, 4]
👉 You start by sorting it:

csharp
Copy code
[2, 2, 3, 4]
🎯 Step 2. Explain the triangle condition
You say:

“For any valid triangle with sides a ≤ b ≤ c,
the only condition we need to check is a + b > c.”

Then draw three sides like this:

css
Copy code
     a
   /   \
  /_____\
 b       c
So if the sum of the smaller two sides is greater than the largest one, a triangle can exist.

🧩 Step 3. Explain the two-pointer setup
Now point to your sorted array and draw pointers:

csharp
Copy code
[2, 2, 3, 4]
 ↑        ↑
 L        R
You explain:

“We fix the largest side as c = 4 (rightmost number).
Now I use two pointers — left starting at 0, and right just before c.
I’ll check pairs (nums[left], nums[right]) for triangle validity with this c.”

⚙️ Step 4. Walk through the process visually
Step A:
sql
Copy code
nums[left] + nums[right] = 2 + 3 = 5 > 4 ✅
✅ Condition holds — that means every value between left and right-1 also forms a triangle, because the array is sorted.

So:

makefile
Copy code
Pairs: (2,3,4) and (2,3,4) → 2 triangles
You say:

“Since nums[left] + nums[right] > c,
all smaller left indices also satisfy it.
I add (right - left) = 2 to the count and move right--.”

Now:

csharp
Copy code
[2, 2, 3, 4]
 ↑     ↑
 L     R
Step B:
sql
Copy code
nums[left] + nums[right] = 2 + 2 = 4 ❌ (not greater)
❌ Not valid → move left++ to increase the sum.

Next iteration:
Move longest to the next largest (3):

csharp
Copy code
[2, 2, 3, 4]
        ↑
     longest = 3
Run two-pointer again:

sql
Copy code
nums[left] + nums[right] = 2 + 2 = 4 > 3 ✅
Add (right - left) = 1 more triangle.

✅ Total = 3 triangles

🧮 Step 5. Summarize pointer logic (draw mini flow diagram)
You can summarize with arrows:

sql
Copy code
while (left < right):
   if nums[left] + nums[right] > nums[longest]:
       count += right - left
       right--
   else:
       left++
Then say:

“If the sum is large enough, move right down to check smaller values.
If not, move left up to increase the sum.”

🕒 Step 6. End with complexity analysis
Draw a quick table on the side:

Step	Complexity	Reason
Sort	O(n log n)	Built-in sort
Two-pointer scan	O(n²)	Nested sweep
Space	O(1)	Constant extra memory

Then conclude:

“So the total runtime is O(n²), which is optimal for this problem.
The space complexity is O(1) since I’m doing everything in-place.”

🧠 TL;DR — the “pitch” you can memorize
“I sort the sides first.
Then, for each largest side c, I use two pointers to find how many pairs (a, b) satisfy a + b > c.
Because the array is sorted, whenever a pair works, all smaller left values also work — so I can add them all in one go.
This gives me an O(n²) optimal solution.”
