Given a binary tree root and an integer target, delete all the leaf nodes with value target.

Note that once you delete a leaf node with value target, if its parent node becomes a leaf node and has the value target, it should also be deleted (you need to continue doing that until you cannot).



Example 1:



Input: root = [1,2,3,2,null,2,4], target = 2
Output: [1,null,3,null,4]
Explanation: Leaf nodes in green with value (target = 2) are removed (Picture in left).
After removing, new nodes become leaf nodes with value (target = 2) (Picture in center).


/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * function TreeNode(val, left, right) {
 *     this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
 *     this.left = (left===undefined ? null : left)
 *     this.right = (right===undefined ? null : right)
 * }
 */
/**
 * @param {TreeNode} root
 * @param {number} target
 * @return {TreeNode}
 */
function removeLeafNodes(root, target) {
  if (!root) return null;

  root.left = removeLeafNodes(root.left, target);
  root.right = removeLeafNodes(root.right, target);

  if (!root.left && !root.right && root.val === target) {
    return null;
  }

  return root;
}
