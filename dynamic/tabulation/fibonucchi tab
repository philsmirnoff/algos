Write a function 'fib(n)' that takes in a number as an argument. The function should return the n-th number of the Fibonucci sequence.
The fisrt and 2nd snumber of the sequence, we sum the previous two.
 the 0th  number of the sequence is 0;
 The 1st number of the sequence is 1


 const fib = (n) => {
  const table = Array(n + 1).fill(0);
  table[1] = 1;
  for (let i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
    table[i + 1] += table[i];
    table [i + 2] += table[i];
    }
    return table[n];
 }

 Time complexity O(n)
 Space complexity O(n)
