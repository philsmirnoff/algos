There are n soldiers standing in a line. Each soldier is assigned a unique rating value.

You have to form a team of 3 soldiers amongst them under the following rules:

Choose 3 soldiers with index (i, j, k) with rating (rating[i], rating[j], rating[k]).
A team is valid if: (rating[i] < rating[j] < rating[k]) or (rating[i] > rating[j] > rating[k]) where (0 <= i < j < k < n).
Return the number of teams you can form given the conditions. (soldiers can be part of multiple teams).



Example 1:

Input: rating = [2,5,3,4,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: We can form three teams given the conditions. (2,3,4), (5,4,1), (5,3,1).

Every team is consist of 3 members, say Left, Middle and Right. (Left = rating[i], Middle = rating[j], Right = rating[k])

If the value is in ascending order: Left < Middle < Right
If the value is in descending order: Left > Middle > Right

By checking the posible Left member count and Right member count, we can then get the total composition count by multiplying them.
(Note that we need to calculate ascending and descending count separately.)

const numTeams = rating => {
  let ans = 0;

  // 'i' is the index of Middle
  for (let i = 1; i < rating.length - 1; i++) {
    let descLeft = 0;
    let descRight = 0;
	let ascLeft = 0;
	let ascRight = 0;

    // Check for Left
    for (let j = 0; j < i; j++) {
      if (rating[j] > rating[i]) descLeft++;
      if (rating[j] < rating[i]) ascLeft++;
    }

    // Check for Right
    for (let j = i + 1; j < rating.length; j++) {
      if (rating[j] < rating[i]) descRight++;
      if (rating[j] > rating[i]) ascRight++;
    }

    ans += descLeft * descRight + ascLeft * ascRight;
  }

  return ans;
};
